1.) Follow the instructions of
https://espace.cern.ch/cms-quarkonia/onia-polarization/Generating%20Events/Detector%20simulation%20for%201E33.aspx 

2.) untar muFixedMuFreeGun_17Jan2012.tgz and compile with "scramv1 b"

3.) generate events by launching "launch_jobs.sh",
which uses the generator script muFreeMuFixedGun_GEN-RECO.py 
--> Generation, Simulation, Reconstruction and Triggering is done in
one setp

4.) The PAT tuple can be produced from the previously generated AOD
file by
cd HeavyFlavorAnalysis/Onia2MuMu/test/
./launch_jobs.sh
the steering itself is done through the script onia2MuMuPATMC_cfg.py
which can be directly executed

5.) the PAT tuples can be analyzed with
launch_analyzer.sh
which uses the script jpsianalyzerpat_MC1E33-3E33_cfg.py (or any of
the other jpsianalyzerpat* scripts).
