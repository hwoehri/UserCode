(1) runMC.C
    steering macro that projects from the RooDataSet containing the generated 
    variables into histograms containing the 1D and 2D distributions of the 
    polarization related variables (cosTheta and phi), which will be the input
    to the macro calculating the Acc*Eff maps from MC. The actual booking and 
    filling of the histograms is done in PolMC.h/C.
    --> cuts implemented in PolMC.C should always be in sync with the
    one in PolData.C
    
(2) runData.C
    steering macro that projects from the RooDataSet into histograms
    containing the 1D and 2D distributions of the polarization related 
    variables (cosTheta and phi). This macro can be run on real data
    as well as on MC. To add the reconstructed histograms for the acceptance
    evaluation to the output file from the previous step ("runMC.C") run
    "runData.C" with the option 
    Bool_t newOutputFile = kFALSE
    Otherwise to store them in a new output file use
    Bool_t newOutputFile = kTRUE
    The actual booking and filling of the histograms is done in PolData.h/C.
    --> cuts implemented in PolData.C should always be in sync with the
    one in PolMC.C

(3) getAcceptance.C
    calculates the product of geometrical acceptance with all efficiencies
    from MC, simply as Acc = RECO / GEN. This is done for the 1D and 2D
    histograms stored in the output file from the previous two steps
    The acceptance maps used for the RooFits of the polarization analyses
    are 2D histos (phi vs cosTheta) for each rapidity and pT bin and are 
    called "hAcc2D_Onia_CS_pT1_rap1" and ""hAcc2D_Onia_HX_pT1_rap1" etc.
    These are stored in a file called "accHistos_HLT_Mu0Track0Jpsi.root"
    (or similar)

    --> the many output plots can be processed by
    cd ../latex
    pdflatex acceptance.tex

(*) plotMass.C
    macro that reads the output of "runData.C", plots the mass distribution
    in the pT and rapidity bins, defined in ../interface/commonVar.h
    fits them to extract the S / BG ratio in a 2.5 sigma interval
    (defined in Double_t nSigma = 2.5;) and saves output figures in 
    the directory "Figures/"

    --> the many plots can be processed by
    cd ../latex
    pdflatex dimuMass_Jpsi_data.tex

(*) checkAccCorrectedSpectra.C
    plots the spectra (phi and cosTheta for the time being) before and after 
    acceptance correction (1D as well as 2D)
