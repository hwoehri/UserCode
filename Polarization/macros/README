(*) runData.C
    steering macro that projects from the RooDataSet into histograms
    containing the 1D and 2D distributions of the polarization related 
    variables (cosTheta and phi). The actual booking and filling of the 
    histograms is done in PolData.h/C.
    --> cuts implemented in PolData.C should always be in sync with the
    one in PolMC.C

(*) plotMass.C
    macro that reads the output of "runData.C", plots the mass distribution
    in the pT and rapidity bins, defined in ../interface/commonVar.h
    fits them to extract the S / BG ratio in a 2.5 sigma interval
    (defined in Double_t nSigma = 2.5;) and saves output figures in 
    the directory "Figures/"

    --> the many plots can be processed by
    cd ../latex
    pdflatex dimuMass_Jpsi_data.tex
