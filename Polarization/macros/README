(*) runData.C
    steering macro that projects from the RooDataSet into histograms
    containing the 1D and 2D distributions of the polarization related 
    variables (cosTheta and phi). The actual booking and filling of the 
    histograms is done in PolData.h/C.
    --> cuts implemented in PolData.C should always be in sync with the
    one in PolMC.C
