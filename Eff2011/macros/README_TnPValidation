In order to conduct the T&P validation test the following steps need to be done:
 
1.) run the script "macros/singleMuTruthEff.C+" which stores in an output
root file the RECO, TRIG and TOTAL single muon efficiencies, on the
basis of the special "single muon particle gun" events. The individual
efficiencies (as a function of eta, pT and phi) are available in the
TEfficiency format. For the TOTAL efficiencies as a function of pT,
also TGraphAsymmErrors are available, which take into account the bin
centre of the events. That is calculated at the end of the macro in
the routine "CalcWeightedAverage". The weighted average is built on
the basis of the RECO+TRIG events (not on the basis of the events that
satisfy the acceptance cuts! That is different w.r.t. the T&P approach
and could be trivially changed). If this is also interesting for the
RECO and TRIG efficiencies, it would need to be implemented.

Note that in step 3.) currently the TGraphAsymmErrors are used for
further processing and not the TEfficiency objects.

2.) Get the latest factorized T&P efficiencies from the dropbox as
well as the "All-in-one-T&P efficiencies" previously studied. (The
latter one is not needed, but the code of step 3 was not upgraded to
ignore it...).

3.) Execute the macro "macros/compareEff.C+" after adjusting the paths to the
input files in the routine "LoadEfficiencies". This builds the ratio
of the T&P and Truth efficiencies, bin by bin, optionally after
linearly extrapolating the efficiency from the MC truth efficiency to
the centre of gravity found in the T&P efficiencies.

4.) change into ../latex and execute "pdflatex compEff.tex". That will
automatically read the figures produced in Step 3 and assemble them in
an output PDF file.
